        <p>He always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life â€” a work of art. He made <i>Blackstar</i> for us, his parting gift. I knew for
          a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now, it is appropriate to cry. - <i >Tony Visconti</i></p>
